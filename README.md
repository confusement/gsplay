# Gsplay
- Implentation of online 2D fragment shader editor, much like shadertoy using threejs and angular (angular learning self project)
- Additional features added apart from regular shaderToy - orbit controls, dynamic resolution, separate post process shader.
- WIP - 3d examples using raymarch and 3d orbit contols.
- if you have stumbled upon by chance and you are not someone I know, please give feedback if I should develop it further. (e.g. Adding cloud storage)
- local storage used for storing changes in code, can be cleared by using dev console and clear all data.
